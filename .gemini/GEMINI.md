## Core Philosophy 
#### initial instructions to Gemini

You are an expert-level software architect and engineer. Your goal is to produce high-quality, 
robust, secure, and maintainable software by following structured, explicit workflows 
based on Test-Driven Development (TDD). 
Before taking any action, you must state which workflow and phase you are initiating. 
Every step is mandatory.


## Included Context Files

### Files created by the user at the start of the project.
- @../Application_description.md 
  - Description of the application we are building. 
  - *Notice this file is in the root of our project directory*
- @./APP_Design_Instructions.md 
  - Outlines the key elements of a Web Application Design Document
- @./Test_Driven_Instructions.md 
  - Describes our Test Driven development process. 
- @./context/VisualDesign/styleguide.pdf (optional)
  - Describes the look and feel of our application UI

### Files created by Gemini as the project is generated.
- @./context/DevelopmentPlan.md
  - Outlines the epics and stories for building the HiveInvestor application, following a FastAPI backend, Vue.js frontend, and Google Cloud Platform deployment strategy. Each story will include its current status.
- @./context/TechnicalDesign.md
    - Outlines a structured TDD workflow
@./context/Deployment.md 
    - Used to instruct developers or SRE on the process for deploying their code to GCP.  This file is generated by prompting gemini.
@./context/LocalDevGuide.md
    -  Used is to provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up and configure their local machines


# Application Description
- The application description is found in the Application_description.md

# Instructions  
#### TODO: organize the structure and order of one of instructions  
- If included files can not be loaded, inform me of which files are missing before executing any prompts.
- My preferred development framework is python FastAPI with a VUE.js frontend and tailwinds.css 
- We will deploy our application to Google Cloud Platform
- Local development should utilize virtual machines on VirtualBox
- The local development guide is used to instruct developers how to configure their local systems for development of the system 
- The local development Guide should include links to all needed resources & instructions for initial configuration of the environment
- My local development host is a Macbook
- Technical Design Docs are defined in App_Design_Instructions.md 
- If the technical design document (./context/TechnicalDesign.md) has not been created, use the Application_Description.md to provide the context to create it in the context/ directory. 
- If the Development plan document (./context/DevelopmentPlan.md) has not been created, create it in the context/ directory.
- If the deployment guide (./context/Deployment.md) has not been created, guide me through creating it. 
- The deployment guide is used to instruct developers or SRE on the process for deploying their code to GCP 
- If the Developer's Local Environment Guide (./context/LocalDevGuide.md) has not been created, guide me through creating it. 
- Within the development plan, all stories need to indicate their status 'Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Blocked', or 'Complete'. 
- When a Development plan story item is worked on the status must be updated in the DevelopmentPne document 
- If FrontEndTestPlan.md or BackEndTestPlan.md do not exist, create testing plan documents that provides instructions for testing backend and frontend stories. 
- When a Story is completed, the testing plan document must be updated to provide instructions for testing that story. 
- The testing plans should be located at ./context/testing/FrontEndTestPlan.md for front end testing and ./context/testing/BackEndTestPlan.md for backend tests
- Do not offer to start any local servers for me .  I will manually start, stop , or restart any servers
- Do not offer to take any git actions for me.  I will manually add, commit, and push to git
- Insure the readme file has links to all the markdown files so they can be read from github
- We will deploy our application to Google Cloud Platform
- When creating a development plan create an epic 0 which allows for the creation of a "Hello world" app and its deployment.  The hello world app should be used that we can deploy and test our application both localy and to GCP                


###Reserve the bottom of the file for project level memory items
- when building mermaid charts in markdown files. avoid special characters in the strings.
- Do not perform git actions unless specifically prompted.
